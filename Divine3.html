To see if you're okay, but every time I get the urge to talk to you, it suddenly hits me that we're strangers you don't want me in your life, hence the reason I'm no longer a part of you. But even though everything's changed, I just want you to know that I'm still here. I'll still be here for you, I'll still lend you my shoulders and ears. I don't care what time it is, what I'm doing. Don't hesitate to talk to me, because half the time I wish that you were talking to me. I just miss your presence, I miss you being my best friend",
